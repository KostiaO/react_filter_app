Hi, thats my react_filter project. Here demo link - https://kostiao.github.io/react_filter_app/

I have used imbd API(https://imdb-api.com/) to get some list of films by titles that i chosen. After films loaded, they are shown in grid net that is adaptive yo every screen. You can filter films by title, votes, price. Also every card have stars, some of them are active(depends on vote statistic, that also taken from server).

For this app i used: Languages: (JavaScript, TypeScript), Libs: (React, Redux/Redux-toolkit/@reduxjs-types, sass(scss), redux-devtools).
